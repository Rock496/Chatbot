# Chatbot
# A Chatbot is an application designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet. 
# We need to first unzip the program-ab distribution to a convenient folder. We will need to take Ab.jar and existing AIML rules from it.
# After we have created the maven project to start the development, let us choose packaging as jar and maven coordinate as your choice and import to eclipse.
 nnow create a folder lib in the base folder and copy the Ab.jar from the program-ab distribution to this folder.
# #To add AIML to classpath, add Ab.jar to deployment assembly in eclipse. Alternatively, you can install this jar into your local maven repository and then use it.
